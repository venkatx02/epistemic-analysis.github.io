Hello,

My name is Venkat, and I’m a graduate student in the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science (DACSS) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. With a bachelor’s degree in computer science and some experience in the corporate world, I’ve developed expertise in web application development and machine learning. Now, I have landed into computational social science which combines computer science and data science with social sciences.

My research focuses on methodology rather than being domain-specific. However, I’m passionate about working across diverse domains, as it fuels my curiosity and enhances my adaptability and learning capabilities. Broadly, my interests are in and around information security, philosophy, political psychology, and international affairs. I’m currently working on a few projects in which I study these topics: determinants of voting behavior in India, the characteristics of countries that lead them to engage in wars and their impacts, and epistemic analysis and classification of modern texts.

I represented Hex Esports, Minus 40 Club and some other organizations in the PUBG MOBILE competitive scene as an academic esports player. I spend my leisure playing video games and cooking. I like to travel and grab some memories in the form of photographs.
