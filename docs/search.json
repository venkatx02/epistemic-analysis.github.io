    "text": "Welcome to the Epistemic Analysis Project! \nThe Epistemic Analysis Project is a research initiative exploring the application of computational methods to identify and analyze epistemological tendencies, specifically rationalism and empiricism, in modern texts, such as social media posts, articles, and other forms of contemporary discourse.\nRationalism and empiricism are two foundational traditions in philosophy, each characterized by distinct approaches to knowledge acquisition. Rationalism emphasizes deductive reasoning and the role of innate ideas, while empiricism focuses on sensory experience and inductive reasoning. This project seeks to develop language-based models capable of detecting these epistemological frameworks in contemporary texts, where ideas are often expressed in fragmented and evolving language."

Rationalism emphasizes deductive reasoning and innate ideas, while empiricism focuses on sensory experience and inductive reasoning. My goal is to develop computational models that can detect these epistemological tendencies in contemporary discourse, such as social media posts, where ideas are often expressed in fragmented and evolving language.\nStudying this question is essential because understanding an individual’s philosophical perspective offers valuable insights into their reasoning patterns, decision-making, and broader worldviews. Rationalism and empiricism represent two foundational approaches to knowledge, shaping arguments in science, politics, business, and everyday discourse. Identifying these epistemological tendencies in modern texts, such as social media posts, enhances our understanding of how people construct arguments, interpret evidence, and engage with information. Such insights could have applications in fields ranging from political analysis, artificial intelligence, business, consumer behavior, education, journalism, and media, helping to refine models of persuasion, belief formation, and knowledge dissemination in the digital age.\nThe Corpus\nTo address this research question, an initial corpus has been compiled of texts explicitly discussing rationalism and empiricism. The primary sources for this corpus are books from Project Gutenberg, featuring works by key rationalist philosophers—René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz—as well as empiricists such as John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. However, as philosophical discourse and linguistic patterns have evolved, the corpus will be expanded to include diverse texts from different periods and contexts. PhilPapers, a comprehensive index and bibliography of philosophy, is a potential source for expanding the corpus.\nCredits: https://philosophydata.com/bibliography.html\nWhy This Corpus?\nThis corpus provides a clear foundation for distinguishing rationalist and empiricist thought. By analyzing argument structures, linguistic patterns, and reasoning styles in classical texts, language models can be trained to recognize epistemological tendencies in contemporary discourse. The selected works offer clear examples of deductive reasoning and innate ideas in rationalism versus sensory-based, inductive reasoning in empiricism. The structured nature of philosophical writings makes them ideal for computational analysis, allowing for effective training and classification of texts based on their underlying epistemic perspectives. Extending the corpus with evolving interpretations in literature will ensure a more comprehensive model that accounts for linguistic shifts and variations in how rationalist and empiricist ideas are expressed, thereby improving the model’s applicability to modern texts like social media posts."
