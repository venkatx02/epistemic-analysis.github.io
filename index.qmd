<b> Welcome to the Epistemic Analysis Project! </b>

The Epistemic Analysis Project is a research initiative exploring the application of computational methods to identify and analyze the epistemological patterns in modern discourse from spaces such as social media, customer reviews, or political debates. This project seeks to develop language-based models capable of detecting these epistemological frameworks in contemporary texts, where ideas are often expressed in fragmented and evolving language. Currently, the focus is on building a reliable classifier that can identify the proportions of rationalism and empiricism in texts, although other schools of thought in epistemology will be systematically included in future phases of this project.
