<b> Welcome to the Epistemic Analysis Project! </b>

The Epistemic Analysis Project is a research initiative exploring the application of computational methods to identify and analyze epistemological tendencies, specifically rationalism and empiricism, in modern texts, such as social media posts, articles, and other forms of contemporary discourse.

Rationalism and empiricism are two foundational traditions in philosophy, each characterized by distinct approaches to knowledge acquisition. Rationalism emphasizes deductive reasoning and the role of innate ideas, while empiricism focuses on sensory experience and inductive reasoning. This project seeks to develop language-based models capable of detecting these epistemological frameworks in contemporary texts, where ideas are often expressed in fragmented and evolving language.
