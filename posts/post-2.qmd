Let's start by looking at the research question and corpus...

<b> Research Question </b>

<b> How can language-based models identify rationalism and empiricism in modern texts, such as social media posts? </b>

Rationalism and empiricism are two foundational epistemological traditions that have shaped philosophical thought for centuries. Rationalism emphasizes deductive reasoning and innate ideas, while empiricism focuses on sensory experience and inductive reasoning. My goal is to develop computational models that can detect these epistemological tendencies in contemporary discourse, such as social media posts, where ideas are often expressed in fragmented and evolving language.

Studying this question is essential because understanding an individual's philosophical perspective offers valuable insights into their reasoning patterns, decision-making, and broader worldviews. Rationalism and empiricism represent two foundational approaches to knowledge, shaping arguments in science, politics, business, and everyday discourse. Identifying these epistemological tendencies in modern texts, such as social media posts, enhances our understanding of how people construct arguments, interpret evidence, and engage with information. Such insights could have applications in fields ranging from political analysis, artificial intelligence, business, consumer behavior, education, journalism, and media, helping to refine models of persuasion, belief formation, and knowledge dissemination in the digital age.

<b>The Corpus</b>

To address this research question, an initial corpus has been compiled of texts explicitly discussing rationalism and empiricism. The primary sources for this corpus are books from Project Gutenberg, featuring works by key rationalist philosophers—René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz—as well as empiricists such as John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. However, as philosophical discourse and linguistic patterns have evolved, the corpus will be expanded to include diverse texts from different periods and contexts. PhilPapers, a comprehensive index and bibliography of philosophy, is a potential source for expanding the corpus.

<b>Corpus Summary</b>

As a starting point, I have collected six books in the empiricism corpus and four books in the rationalism corpus. These are foundational books that discuss empiricism and rationalism, respectively. A summary of the corpora can be found in the image below:

<b>Corpus Readability</b>

Generally, a Flesch reading ease score between 60 and 70 and a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 8 are considered ideal for most content. However, our corpus does not fall into these benchmarks. One perspective is that contemporary language differs significantly from classical philosophical language in terms of word choice, linguistic patterns, and argumentative style. This is a significant gap in the classification of philosophical schools of thought. In this study, I aim to address this gap by incorporating periodically diverse texts into the corpus to enhance classification performance in modern texts.

<b>Initial Cleaning</b>

For now, the corpora have undergone basic preprocessing to examine word patterns. After tokenization, punctuation, numbers, and stopwords were removed. All tokens were converted to lowercase to ensure consistency.

<b>Word Frequency</b>

The above bar graphs show the frequency of the top 10 words from both corpora. The word "one" is not only common in the epistemological categories of empiricism and rationalism but is also widely used in classical philosophical texts, regardless of the school of thought, in various contexts. More care should be taken in the preprocessing of texts, particularly in handling these kind of concepts.

<b>Word Cloud</b>

The word clouds allow us to examine the top 200 words in both the empiricism and rationalism corpora. So, what can we take away from them?

<b>Bigram Frequency</b>

A bigram is a pair of two consecutive tokens. The bar graphs below allow us to examine the frequency of bigrams in both corpora.

<b>Trigram Frequency</b>

Similar to a bigram, a trigram is a set of three consecutive tokens. Here is the frequency distribution of trigrams in our corpora.
